asymptotic notations are the mathematical notions to denote the order of growth of any mathematical functions.

There are three types of asymptotic notations:
    1. Big o
    2. Theta
    3. Omega

Why do we need upper bound of the notations?
    - to calculate the worst case scearios of mathematical functions.
